description: The Imaginarium is a video game about a child named Sam who is told to clean up their toys from around the house; getting bored, with each pickup of a toy, the child imagines being in a castle, where they face off against lava pits, enemies with bows and swords, and have to navigate throughout a maze by finding keys to unlock doors. <br> I worked on story narration and UI elements. I designed all of the menus (Main, Pause, End) and all of the displays (Arrow Counter, Health and Stamina Bars, Enemy Health). Along with the designing, I brought life to the UI elements by coding them, to ensure maximum functionality. <br> For more information and a more in-depth look into what I did, you can follow the link here
